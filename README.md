# 28-Pins-PCB

During my Spring 2023 Semester, I began my first personal project by enrolling in a Udemy course, "Learn to Design Your Boards," by Robert Feranec.

I did this to gain insight into some of the tools used in the Electrical Engineering industry. This project specifically taught me the basics of Altium Designer, the most common software used for PCB (Printed-Circuit-Board) Design jobs.

The course was step-by-step, from creating parts and wiring schematics to creating 3-D and 2-D footprints, placing all the parts on the PCB, and wiring all components.

By the end, I had designed a 28 Pin PCB Board based on an Arduino UNO Schematic. I had created sufficient documentation to assemble the PCB Board if I wanted to bring the board to life fully.

I am grateful for all I have learned from the course, mainly because it made me familiar with Altium Designer and introduced me to PCB Design. I look forward to returning to Altium if I go further into the PCB design industry.

Thank you!
